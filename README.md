# DataProjects
Applied Knowledge exercises as I work through Machine learning courses. The data set came from OpenData.gov and is downloaded in the linear regression lesson (step1).   

Some of the exercises were expanded on from examples in the Excellent tuorial at

Additional Exercises expanded on from the terrific turotial at https://pythonprogramming.net/regression-introduction-machine-learning-tutorial/?completed=/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/.

Shared code for educational purposes is exactly what Jupyter was created to do.  Thanks to every member of the data community for contributing what they can.
